# Pac-Man game using A* pathfinding algorithm

My implementation of the Pac-Man game using OpenGL for rendering. 
The code is written in C++.

The labyrinth is represented through the graph, which allows the implementation of the A* pathfinding algorithm for ghosts.

The following GDrive link leads to a short video demonstration of the game:

To run the program from Visual Studio 2022, set the configuration to x86 Release, then build and run.
